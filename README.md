# Hillsborough-Disaster
In this project I have examined the effect of the Hillsborough Disaster on the football related arrests in the UK.

Initially I generated a dataset that contains data on football related arrests by every team in English football between the years 1987-1994.
In order to measure the effect I divided the dataset into 2 groups:
Treatment group - Premier League & Championship teams
Control group - 3rd & 4th divisions teams
Finally, each team was associated with the city to which it belongs.

For each city in the dataset there was information about - Attendance of fans (Thousands), Arrests of fans, percent of arrests, Expenditure on beer and tobacco per head, income per head, population and regional unemployment rate

The analysis was made with the Difference in Differences method, so that the difference between the groups is measured along with the difference before and after the disaster.

After performing the analysis there seems to be a significant decrease in the football related arrests among the treatment group while there is not a coherent change after the disaster among the control group.
